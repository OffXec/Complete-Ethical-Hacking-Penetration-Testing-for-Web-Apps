If you are getting the error "The database server appears to be offline" while accessing mutillidae

Please go to the bin directory of mysql in wamp

(normally it will be in C: directory by default , Use your computer's path to wamp)

For example, in my computer, I have used the commands

cd C:\wamp64\bin\mysql\mysql5.7.21\bin

Now it will be at the prompt C:\wamp64\bin\mysql\mysql5.7.21\bin> 

Type the following commands:

mysql -u root

use mysql

update user set authentication string=PASSWORD('multillidae') where user='root';

update user set plugin='mysql_native_password' where user='root';

flush privileges;

quit;

Then try to access mutillidae 









If you have installed apache2 standalone in linux, the web folder path will be "htdocs" rather than "www"

OR 

some distros will have it in  /opt/lampp/htdocs

OR

some distros may be having it in  /var/www
